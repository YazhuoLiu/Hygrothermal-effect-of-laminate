function [A,B,D] = Composite_material_stiffness_matrix(Qcell, thetadt, h_ply)
% This is a function used to calculate the stiffness matrix of fiber reinforced composites,
% which is made up of same Lamina in different angles.

% Q:        2D stiffness matrix in SI units
% thetadt:  Angle from top in degree
% h_ply:    Thickness of each layer in SI units

    % The position of the neutral surface of each layer
